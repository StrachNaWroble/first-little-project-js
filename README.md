It is my first try to write something in java script, so it's gonna be shitty. But this time I decided to start showing myself the progress, which I guess will also be a great motivation. Woooho the vacation started, and this year I am not gonna waste it, at least not entirely.

After a day, I haven't done much with the project, and for now it's just a shape going left, right, up and down allllll the time. Although I made great progress in understanding how this whole thing works on my computer and how to get it going. So overall, I guess I am proud of myself. Oh, and almost forgot: I fucking figured out how the website even works (which I know is late but still took a hell of a time).
